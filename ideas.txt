needs some way to iterate
i.e. start again with more knowledge/better resources
i like the idea of taking over all islands in a particular map
    and when you are finished, move to another island group
    and you get more resources/better research
    so what of the current research patterns
    we can keep the same, but the research items are only unlockable when you get to new territories?
    that works, but maybe new territories increase the research facility level, which then unlocks the items

one main island
lots of other islands you colonize
    unowned islands
        these will have a default amount of gold which can only be plundered once
    owned islands
when you start, there is an uncolonized island near you that you can conquer

some kind of autonomous set up
so that things are automatically built, maybe another building for it?
can also send to other items on some quota
i.e.
    build mercenaries, until 5
    build small merchant ships until 1
    send 5 mercenaries to different island using 1 small merchant ship
    send small merchant ship back

if buildings are upgrading then they cant make anything, i.e. gold mine produces no gold

    gold mine
        levels
            levels 1 - 5 for free
            levels 6 - 10 after researching "better pickaxes"
            levels 11 - 15 after researching "heavy lifting equipment"
            levels 16 - 20 after researching "explosives"
        set notifications when you reach a certain amount of gold
        can also be configured from the thing you want to build i.e. "notify me when I have enough gold"
    gold refinery
        levels 1 - 10 after researching "chemistry"
        levels 11 - 20 after researching "micro chemistry"
    barracks
        levels
            levels 1 - 20 for free
        upgrading barracks makes training faster
            plus unlocks new things, such as explorer
    shipyard
        levels 1 - 10 for free
            allows you to build warships and small merchant ships
            at level 10 you can build big merchant ships
        levels 11 - 20 after "heavy lifting equipment"
            at level 20, aircraft carriers can be built
    cannon factory
        levels 1 - 10 after researching explosives
        levels 11 - 20 after researching better explosives
    research facility
        1 better pickaxes
            heavy lifting equipment
            chemistry
                explosives
                    better explosives
                micro chemistry
            faster building

army
    warships
    small/big merchant ships
        can transport:
            mercenaries (1 space)
            gold (100 per space)
            cannons (5 spaces)
    small merchant ship
        5 spaces
    big merchant ship
        25 spaces
    aircraft carrier?
        basically a really powerful warship
    mercenary
    cannon
    explorer
        allows for colonization
        at level 10 barracks

resources
    gold

tutorial
    make a merchant ship and plunder another island
