needs some way to iterate
i.e. start again with more knowledge/better resources
i like the idea of taking over all islands in a particular map
    and when you are finished, move to another island group
    and you get more resources/better research
    so what of the current research patterns
    we can keep the same, but the research items are only unlockable when you get to new territories?


one main island
lots of other islands you colonize
    unowned islands
    owned islands
when you start, there is an uncolonized island near you that you can conquer

some kind of autonomous set up
so that things are automatically built, maybe another building for it?
can also send to other items on some quota
i.e.
    build mercenaries, until 5
    build small merchant ships until 1
    send 5 mercenaries to different island using 1 small merchant ship
    send small merchant ship back
